# sample-store

Limitest is a React frontend application designed to work with [Backend project](https://github.com/smmk123/node-express-backend). It utilizes Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend API and Context to manage user credentials.

## Features

- User authentication: Limitest allows users to authenticate themselves using their credentials.
- API communication: The application communicates with your demo backend using Axios, allowing users to interact with the API endpoints.
- Context-based user management: User credentials are stored and managed using React Context, providing a centralized state for authentication information.

## Prerequisites

To run the Limitest application locally, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ysmmk123/sample-store.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd limitest
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your backend API:

   - Replace the API endpoint URLs in the codebase with your own backend API endpoints. Look for occurrences of `https://api.example.com` and replace them with the appropriate URLs.

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the Limitest application.

## Configuration

In order to properly configure the Limitest application, you need to modify a few files:

- **src/context/AuthContext.js**: Update the `login` and `logout` functions to handle authentication with your backend. You may need to modify the API requests and responses based on your backend's authentication mechanism.

- **src/services/api.js**: Adjust the base URL of your backend API in the `axiosInstance` configuration. You may also need to customize the request headers and error handling based on your backend's requirements.
